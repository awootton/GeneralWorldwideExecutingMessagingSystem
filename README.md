# GeneralWorldwideExecutingMessagingSystem1
The start of the distributed message system in AWS. It's an eclipse project.

A work in progress...

I thought it was always a part of the VR lore, eg. Snow Crash or Ready Player One etc, that it was a shared experience. I would not want to risk a personal interpretation of that (I am not a  designer) but I think there are fundamentals:

1) It's open. Like the internet. It is not owned by any company. It's open source. It's an open spec.

2) Assets, geometry etc, can be associated with particular coordinates. If a camera visits that location in space it will find those assets which can presumably be rendered into 3D. Individuals (legal entities) can, and will, have rights to exclusively control some spaces. This would mean that one could tour, by moving through space, 3d samples as if driving by houses, parks or other real estate. 

3) A camera, a person or avatar, can associate geometry or assets with itself so that when the camera is in a space it will (and perhaps must) have an appearance in addition to a location. This would mean that one could attend a parade and virtually see people passing by in a public space or that one might be in a parade and see those watching.

4) It's interactive. This is implied by #3. Messages (or digital media) can be broadcast from a location (possibly a location that changes over time) and received by entities within a range, or having an interest, in a very short amount of time. Chat, audio conversations, and video are possible. 

6) It's programmable. Behavior of anything and everything inside of some spaces can be completely redefined by the owner of that space. It is only necessary for the world to agree on very basic message passing rules and capabilities. Code can be injected into the system. 

7) It's massively scalable and, as an architecture, could span the internet. 

This (along with #1 above) implies that it doesn't execute in a particular location under the control of a particular organization. This means that persons can run the entirety of the software locally either to provide a private shared space (like an intranet), or an open space while still being connected to the rest of the metaversenet. This means that LAN parties for the purpose of running a game with very low latencies while still being seamlessly connected are possible. This implies a very difficult architecture where a broadcast might reach millions in double digit millisecond timeframes.

What does this mean to you?

You can add real time interactivity to your project now. We can together begin to define some of the ways in which we, as designers and programmers and architects, would like to interact with the system I am calling the metaversenet. I am proposing that the interaction happens in Javascript similar to WebVR and that there will be an API for that. You can influence what the most basic API's will look like and YOU can build additional capabilities on top of that framework.
